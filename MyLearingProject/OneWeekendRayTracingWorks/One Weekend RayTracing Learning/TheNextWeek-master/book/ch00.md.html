Chapter 0: Overview
====================

In Ray Tracing In One Weekend, you built a simple brute force path tracer. In this installment we’ll
add textures, volumes (like fog), rectangles, instances, lights, and support for lots of objects
using a BVH. When done, you’ll have a “real” ray tracer.

A heuristic in ray tracing that many people--including me--believe, is that most optimizations
complicate the code without delivering much speedup. What I will do in this mini-book is go with the
simplest approach in each design decision I make. Check http://www.in1weekend.com/ for readings and
references to a more sophisticated approach. However, I strongly encourage you to do no premature
optimization; if it doesn’t show up high in the execution time profile, it doesn’t need optimization
until all the features are supported!

The two hardest parts of this book are the BVH and the Perlin textures. This is why the title
suggests you take a week rather than a weekend for this endeavor. But you can save those for last if
you want a weekend project. Order is not very important for the concepts presented in this book, and
without BVH and Perlin texture you will still get a Cornell Box!
