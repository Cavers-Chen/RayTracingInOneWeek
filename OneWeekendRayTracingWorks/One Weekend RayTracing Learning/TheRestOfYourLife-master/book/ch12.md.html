                               **Chapter 12: The Rest of Your Life**

The purpose of this book was to show the details of dotting all the i’s of the math on one way of
organizing a physically-based renderer’s sampling approach. Now you can explore a lot of different
potential paths.

If you want to explore Monte Carlo methods, look into bidirectional and path spaced approaches such
as Metropolis. Your probability space won't be over solid angle but will instead be over path space,
where a path is a multidimensional point in a high-dimensional space. Don’t let that scare you -- if
you can describe an object with an array of numbers, mathematicians call it a point in the space of
all possible arrays of such points. That’s not just for show. Once you get a clean abstraction like
that, your code can get clean too. Clean abstractions are what programming is all about!

If you want to do movie renderers, look at the papers out of studios and Solid Angle. They are
surprisingly open about their craft.

If you want to do high-performance ray tracing, look first at papers from Intel and NVIDIA. Again,
they are surprisingly open.

If you want to do hard-core physically-based renderers, convert your renderer from RGB to spectral.
I am a big fan of each ray having a random wavelength and almost all of the RGBs in your program
turning into floats. It sounds inefficient, but it isn’t!

Regardless of what direction you take, add a glossy BRDF model. There are many to choose from and
each has its advantages.

Finally, please send me your images and fixes and complaints! I will maintain links to further
reading etc. at  in1weekend.com

Have fun!
